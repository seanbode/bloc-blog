* Summary
    - My goal for creating this application was to better familiarize myself with angularjs. The added bonus and challenge was working with firebase. The firebase instructions made much of the work with firebase work well. The challenge came with getting the user to display with the message.
* Explanation
    -  
* Problem
    -  The biggest roadblock was the unfamiliarity with firebase. Although the intuitive instructions made much of the setup quite easy. Setting the proper assortment of keys became an awkward conversion that lead to much second-guessing.
    - New messages where not being displayed. I kept getting errors in the console log relating to a non-specific error regarding angularjs. A common problem with angularjs errors.  
    - work completed in the dist folder would summarily be written over when the website was refreshed on the server.
* Solution
    - Although the roadblock of firebase's unfamiliar design was offputting it in the end became a distraction as the real problems where often with the setup of angularjs.
    - avoiding the dist folder altogether for work was the most fruitful path forward as the work would just be reset back to the work in the app folder.
* Results
* Conclusion
