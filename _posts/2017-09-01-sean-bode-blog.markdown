    Retroactive Case Studies.

    Mistakes are the food for growth. I should have been writing case studies for all of my projects however, I have not. As a means to practice and get into the habit, I am now attempting to retroactively put together case studies from my recollections of these projects that will help illustrate my progress through bloc.

<h3>
    Goal:
</h3>
<p>
    Its been my goal thus far to learn to program. Javascript and Ruby had been alien to me when I began and now I have developed not only understanding of the languages but a comprehension on where to find the answers I don't know.
<br>
    Its also been my goal to learn to communicate this language and the concepts and ideas that make the world of coding function. Communication was my area of expertise as I had come from sales. Sharing this endeavor with friends always brings about an almost reverential feel when introduced to non-coders. Non-coders can describe most of my friends who shy away from coding like its terrifying when I first bring up my latest project.

<!-- Your experience with Bloc -->
<h3>
    Bloc Experience:
</h3>
<p>
   Over the course of my time at bloc I’ve had to learn to keep up with mentors much more experienced then I am. I’ve had to figure out programming puzzles that test the limits of my knowledge. More recently I’ve had to examine my work and provide case studies for those problems to better analyze them for solutions. I’ve had to solve problems that I often would look at as unsolvable and keep going.

<!-- The biggest challenge you've faced when learning to develop -->
<h3>
    Biggest Challenge:
</h3>
<p>
    I have little experience in coding. Most of my experience comes from making sales calls and a videography business that was never as fruitful as I needed it to be. If you asked me last year what a click handler was I would have shrugged. Now I can tell you it’s the reason your clicks spark new reactions on a page. But the biggest challenge hasn’t been whether or not I understand the program, but learning that mistakes are good and communicating that which I understand. 
<br>
    This challenge has kept me on the ropes for much of my time at bloc, however understanding that mistakes are necessary, good even has allowed me to grow as a developer. To take those times where I didn’t think I could find a solution and buckle through and find a solution.
