short-description: a self-destructing to-do list application with rake automation.
---
* Summary
    - similar to blocipedia I was further familiarizing myself with practices of CRUD (create read update and destroy) by building this application that would enable a user to generate a to-do list that they could create tasks in, update the tasks, and enable destruction of those tasks via the rake automation.
* Explanation
    - I wanted to keep the goal simple. Create a to do list that would destroy it's items based on date so it would not have old goals on it that would just linger and create clutter.
* Problem
    - The problems I encountered:
        + identification of a user identity.
        + enabling rake automation.
* Solution
    - taking a step away provided the clearest solution.
* Results
* Conclusion
